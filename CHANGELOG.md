# Changelog

All notable changes to LocalHarness are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), and the project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (pre-1.0: interfaces may change).

## [0.5.3] — 2026-07-03

(0.5.2 is intentionally skipped — that number is already publicly attached to the
in-progress hierarchical-memory milestone on the devnotes page.)

### Changed
- **The default subagent roster is now quarantined-or-read-only.** `data-analyst` and
  `frontend-designer` no longer ship in the default roster: both hold `bash_exec`
  (host-dangerous), which sat uneasily next to the harness's fenced-by-construction
  security story, and neither had bench coverage. A live quality battery (2026-07-03,
  receipts in the repo history of this entry) found `frontend-designer`'s first-run
  build task hangs against an undeclared Playwright dependency; `data-analyst` passed
  its battery cleanly and was demoted on security posture alone. Both are preserved as
  fully documented opt-in configs under `examples/agents/` — drop one into
  `~/.localharness/agents/` to restore it. The remaining defaults: `explore`
  (read-only), `web-researcher` (web-quarantined), `search-verifier` (blind verifier),
  `cruncher` (grant-fed reducer), plus your own YAML agents.
- The grant-target safety gate and its tests now exercise host-dangerous CONFIG
  children (yaml allowlists) rather than host-dangerous builtins — there are none left.

### Fixed
- `memory_search` no longer fails on hyphenated queries ("no such column: in") —
  FTS5 MATCH input is tokenized and quoted, so operator characters in real-world
  queries (`built-in`, `000660.KS`, `P/GP`) are literal terms, never syntax.
- No-tool instant answers no longer terminate with a meta "I already provided the
  answer" summary. The act-guard and self-check prompts now state that only the
  latest reply is user-visible, and the self-check confirm path is a deterministic
  sentinel (`CONFIRMED`) whose summary selection walks back to the answer it
  confirmed — cheaper and loss-free versus asking the model to repeat itself.

## [0.5.1] — 2026-06-26

### Added
- **Number provenance for over-window document reading.** LocalHarness reads documents
  larger than the model's context window by fully reading every section and combining the
  notes — losslessly, on local hardware. As of 0.5.1, when that combine runs in multiple
  stages, every figure in the final answer is checked back against the verbatim per-section
  notes the model actually read, and any figure that doesn't trace back is surfaced. This
  keeps the numbers in an over-window answer anchored to their source — built for financial
  filings, contracts, and long reports, where a drifted figure is unacceptable.

  Verified by deterministic tests in both directions (through the real reduction path), an
  independent adversarial review, and a live run on a real 27B local model over a
  ~600k-character filing (0 of 24 figures flagged on a faithful answer; all 24 confirmed
  present in the notes). Surfaced as a warning, never a silent rewrite; engages on large
  multi-stage reductions; figure-matching is heuristic.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-25

### Added
- **Lossless, secured over-window context.** Cross-agent content grants (hand a child a
  handle, not re-inlined bytes) plus a "cruncher" subagent that reads an over-window
  document by handle and faithfully map-reduces it — every chunk fully read, nothing
  truncated — with structure-aware splitting and per-section context headers.
- A **capability floor**: untrusted-ingested web/tool content cannot co-reside with
  host-dangerous tools in the same agent (defense-in-depth above model refusal).
- Bench instrumentation for over-window eviction, plus a scored faithfulness scenario.
