# Security Policy

## Supported versions

LocalHarness is early-stage (v0.x). Security fixes land on the latest `main`;
there are no long-term-support branches yet.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues **privately** — do not open a public issue.

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:
[**Report a vulnerability**](https://github.com/ahwurm/localharness/security/advisories/new).
Include reproduction steps and impact. You will get an acknowledgment, and a fix
or mitigation will be coordinated before any public disclosure.

## Trust boundaries

LocalHarness runs tools — including `bash` and file writes — on the machine where
the harness runs, driven by a local model. **Treat agent definitions and any
connected MCP servers as trusted code**: review them the way you would review code,
because they decide what the agents are allowed to do.

**Workspace config from outside your project is not trusted by default.** From v0.13 the harness
looks for a `.localharness/` directory at or above your current directory and can load agent and
division files from it. If that directory is the one you are standing in, or it sits inside the same
git repository you are working in, it loads straight away — it is part of the project you already
opened, and every directory inside a project inherits that project's config. If it sits somewhere
else — above your repository's root, or in a parent folder while you are not in a repository at all
— the harness asks once before loading it. Your answer is recorded in your global
`~/.localharness/trusted_workspaces.yaml`, never inside the workspace itself, so a directory can
never vouch for itself. Edit that file to change an answer. When there is no terminal to ask — a
script, a cron job, CI — that workspace layer is ignored and the run continues without it.

**What this does NOT cover.** If you clone someone's repository and run the harness inside it, that
repository's `.localharness/agents/` loads with no prompt, because you are inside that project.
Agent files decide an agent's role, model and tool permissions, so read them in an unfamiliar
repository before you run the harness there, the same way you would read its build scripts. Plugins
and the org-level guardrails file are never taken from a workspace in v0.13 — they load from your
global config directory only.

## Threat model: prompt injection

Agents fetch web pages and call tools, then act on what they read. The central risk
is **prompt injection**: attacker-controlled text in a fetched page or tool result
trying to make an agent take a host action it should not. This is not hypothetical —
the companion morning-report job runs agents with `bash` and web tools, on a
schedule, over live pages no human vetted first.

**Primary defense: separation, enforced structurally.** An agent that ingests
untrusted content is never the same agent that can mutate the host. Host-mutating
tools (`bash`, file `write`/`edit`) are kept out of any agent that fetches or ingests
untrusted text. This is enforced where an agent's tools are resolved: a host-mutating
toolset combined with untrusted ingestion is rejected, and the check **fails closed**
(deny on doubt). Untrusted content moves between agents only as opaque handles
carrying a sticky "untrusted" tag; its raw bytes resolve only inside an agent that
holds no host-mutating tools. This covers built-in web and tool-result ingestion and
MCP tools today; one known gap remains — a plugin pulled in through inherited global
scope still needs a per-tool ingestion tag to be caught.

**Not yet built: sandboxing.** Host-mutating tools currently run with the machine's
full trust; there is no OS-level sandbox (e.g. bubblewrap) around them yet. That is on
the roadmap. Until it ships, the separation above is the containment — so **run the
harness as a non-privileged user**, and isolate it in a container or VM if it will
process untrusted content on a machine you care about.

**Known residual (named, not closed).** The separation blocks *verbatim* untrusted
bytes from reaching a host-mutating agent. It does not fully block *laundered*
influence: an agent with no host tools can read untrusted content and hand a summary
to an agent that has them. Summarizing degrades an attacker's control but does not
eliminate it. Closing this fully is a larger change, deferred until a live test shows
it is exploitable on the target model.

**Not a current vector: memory.** Tool output is written to per-agent history, not to
the queryable facts memory, and no code path promotes tool output into the facts an
agent recalls. If that changes, this section changes with it.

## Securing the endpoint

Inference servers ship with no authentication. On a network with untrusted devices,
start the server with an API key and set `provider.api_key` to match; for access
beyond your LAN use a private overlay network (Tailscale/WireGuard). Never port-forward
a bare, unauthenticated endpoint to the internet. See "Running the harness on a
different machine than the model" in the README.
