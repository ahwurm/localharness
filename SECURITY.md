## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues **privately** — do not open a public issue.

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting:
[**Report a vulnerability**](https://github.com/ahwurm/localharness/security/advisories/new).
Include reproduction steps and impact. You will get an acknowledgment, and a fix
or mitigation will be coordinated before any public disclosure.

## Trust boundaries

LocalHarness runs tools — including `bash` and file writes — on the machine where
the harness runs, driven by a local model. **Treat agent definitions and any
connected MCP servers as trusted code**: review them the way you would review code,
because they decide what the agents are allowed to do.

**Workspace config from outside your project is not trusted by default.** From v0.13 the harness
looks for a `.localharness/` directory at or above your current directory and can load agent and
division files from it. If that directory is the one you are standing in, or it sits inside the same
git repository you are working in, it loads straight away — it is part of the project you already
opened, and every directory inside a project inherits that project's config. If it sits somewhere
else — above your repository's root, or in a parent folder while you are not in a repository at all
— the harness asks once before loading it. Your answer is recorded in your global
`~/.localharness/trusted_workspaces.yaml`, never inside the workspace itself, so a directory can
never vouch for itself. Edit that file to change an answer. When there is no terminal to ask — a
script, a cron job, CI — that workspace layer is ignored and the run continues without it. `doctor`,
`validate` and `agent create` also take `--no-input`, which declines to be asked at all: the layer is
skipped, the run says so, and nothing is recorded. Use it wherever a process might otherwise answer a
permanent trust question on your behalf — hooks, CI, anything scheduled.

**Three edges of that gate, as it behaves today.** Each is a case where the "inside your project"
test lands narrower or wider than you might guess. Know which before you rely on it.

- A **linked git worktree** reads as outside its parent project. The repository-root walk stops at
  the worktree's own root, so a `.localharness/` in the main checkout is treated as external and you
  are asked about your own repository.
- A **folder that is not in a git repository** counts as in-project only at the exact directory that
  holds `.localharness/`. From a subdirectory of it, the workspace is external — asked about if there
  is a terminal, skipped if there is not.
- A recorded **"no" does not apply from inside that project**. The in-project test runs before the
  recorded answer is read, so a workspace you declined from outside loads silently once you are
  standing in it. Declining is a decision about loading a distant directory's config, not a way to
  disable a project's own config while you work in it.

**What this does NOT cover.** If you clone someone's repository and run the harness inside it, that
repository's `.localharness/agents/` loads with no prompt, because you are inside that project.
Agent files decide an agent's role, model and tool permissions, so read them in an unfamiliar
repository before you run the harness there, the same way you would read its build scripts. Plugins
and the org-level guardrails file are never taken from a workspace — they load from your global
config directory only. For the guardrails file that is a mechanism rather than a side effect: the
memory store is given the global directory as a separate input from the directory its own state
lives in, so a workspace cannot silence the org's safety context by shipping its own copy of the
file, and cannot blank it by having no copy at all. One crossing does exist and it is yours to make:
`/memory promote` copies a memory out of a project's store into your machine-global store, so a
memory learned inside an untrusted repository can reach your global memory **if you promote it**.
The harness never promotes anything on its own — nothing runs it, nothing suggests it — and the
promoted copy records which project it came from, so you can see the origin and undo the copy.

**Inside a workspace, file writes and commands default to the project folder.** When a workspace
layer applies, the write and edit tools and the working directory for `bash_exec` default to the
folder that contains `.localharness/` — the project you are standing in. Outside a workspace the
default is unchanged and those tools are unconfined, exactly as before. A `workspace_root` you set
in your own config still wins either way. Read this honestly: it is a default that narrows what the
tools reach by accident, not a sandbox. A command run through `bash_exec` can still leave that
folder, and the deny patterns remain the mechanism that stops specific actions.

## What `localharness start` writes without asking

Two things happen on a start that are worth knowing about, because both write into your config
directory and neither stops to ask.

**Your `config.yaml` gains any newly-shipped default deny patterns.** New releases add to the
default deny list, but `localharness init` baked the list into your `config.yaml` when you first set
up, so a later addition would never reach you. On the first start after an upgrade the harness folds
the missing ones in. It is additive only — it never removes or reorders an entry you wrote, touches
no other key, and is gated on the `defaults_revision` stamp your config carries, so a default you
deliberately deleted is not re-added. A
timestamped `config.yaml.bak-<stamp>` is written before the change, and the change is announced:
`i  Security defaults updated (revision 0 → 1): added 24 deny pattern(s) — additive only; backup at
…`. State it plainly: **this happens without asking you.** The reason it is not a prompt is that the
change only ever tightens the deny list and a start that blocks on a question is a start that fails
in a script. The reason it is not invisible is `localharness doctor`, which prints the revision your
config carries, the revision shipped, and the backup path — so you can see the change after the
announcement has scrolled away. `localharness config migrate --dry-run` prints exactly what a start
would add, and writes nothing. Whether this should stay automatic is an open question for the
project owner; the behavior above is what ships today, not a settled ruling.

**`start` also seeds `<config-dir>/tools/design-screenshot.js`.** The frontend-designer builtin
shells out to that script by path, so the package copies it into your config directory's `tools/`
folder on first run. It is idempotent — present means untouched — it is written to your global
config directory and never into a workspace, and a failure to copy it is a warning rather than a
blocked start. It is the only file `start` installs from the package.

## Threat model: prompt injection

Agents fetch web pages and call tools, then act on what they read. The central risk
is **prompt injection**: attacker-controlled text in a fetched page or tool result
trying to make an agent take a host action it should not. This is not hypothetical —
the companion morning-report job runs agents with `bash` and web tools, on a
schedule, over live pages no human vetted first.

**Primary defense: separation, enforced structurally.** An agent that ingests
untrusted content is never the same agent that can mutate the host. Host-mutating
tools (`bash`, file `write`/`edit`) are kept out of any agent that fetches or ingests
untrusted text. This is enforced where an agent's tools are resolved: a host-mutating
toolset combined with untrusted ingestion is rejected, and the check **fails closed**
(deny on doubt). Untrusted content moves between agents only as opaque handles
carrying a sticky "untrusted" tag; its raw bytes resolve only inside an agent that
holds no host-mutating tools. This covers built-in web and tool-result ingestion and
MCP tools today; one known gap remains — a plugin pulled in through inherited global
scope still needs a per-tool ingestion tag to be caught.

**Not yet built: sandboxing.** Host-mutating tools currently run with the machine's
full trust; there is no OS-level sandbox (e.g. bubblewrap) around them yet. That is on
the roadmap. Until it ships, the separation above is the containment — so **run the
harness as a non-privileged user**, and isolate it in a container or VM if it will
process untrusted content on a machine you care about.

**Known residual (named, not closed).** The separation blocks *verbatim* untrusted
bytes from reaching a host-mutating agent. It does not fully block *laundered*
influence: an agent with no host tools can read untrusted content and hand a summary
to an agent that has them. Summarizing degrades an attacker's control but does not
eliminate it. Closing this fully is a larger change, deferred until a live test shows
it is exploitable on the target model.

**Not a current vector: memory.** Tool output is written to per-agent history, not to
the queryable facts memory, and no code path promotes tool output into the facts an
agent recalls. If that changes, this section changes with it.

## Securing the endpoint

Inference servers ship with no authentication. On a network with untrusted devices,
start the server with an API key and set `provider.api_key` to match; for access
beyond your LAN use a private overlay network (Tailscale/WireGuard). Never port-forward
a bare, unauthenticated endpoint to the internet. See "Running the harness on a
different machine than the model" in the README.
